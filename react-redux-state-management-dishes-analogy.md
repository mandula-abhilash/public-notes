Let's use the analogy of cooking and cleaning dishes to explain how to manage state in React using `useState`, `useEffect`, and Redux.

<br />

1. `useState`:

    Imagine you're cooking a meal and you have various ingredients and utensils that you need to keep track of. In React, you can use the `useState` hook to define the initial state of your cooking process. For example, you might have a state variable called `cookingState` that keeps track of the ingredients you have, the current cooking step, and other relevant information:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    
    function CookingApp() {
      const [cookingState, setCookingState] = useState(initialState);
    
      // Rest of the component code
    }
    ```
<br />

2. `useEffect`:

    While cooking, there might be certain tasks you want to perform based on specific conditions or changes in the cooking process. In React, you can use the `useEffect` hook to handle these actions. For example, you might have a `useEffect` hook that triggers whenever the `cookingState` changes and updates the UI or performs other actions:
    
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    
    function CookingApp() {
      const [cookingState, setCookingState] = useState(initialState);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        // Update the UI or perform other actions based on cookingState
        // For example, you can display a timer for the current cooking step
      }, [cookingState]);
    
      // Rest of the component code
    }
    ```
<br />

3. Redux:

    In a cooking scenario, you may want to manage the state of your cooking process across multiple components. Redux can help you create a centralized state store that can be accessed and updated by different parts of your application.
    
    In Redux, you have a global state store that holds the cooking process state, and you use actions and reducers to modify that state. For example, you might have an action called `addIngredient` that dispatches the addition of an ingredient to your cooking process:
    
    ```jsx
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    
    // Define initial state and reducer
    const initialState = {
      // Cooking state properties
    };
    
    function cookingReducer(state = initialState, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'ADD_INGREDIENT':
          // Update the state by adding the ingredient to the cooking process
          return {
            ...state,
            // Update the cooking state based on the action payload
          };
        // Other cases for different actions
    
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
    
    // Create the Redux store
    const store = createStore(cookingReducer);
    
    // Dispatch an action to add an ingredient
    store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_INGREDIENT', payload: { name: 'Tomato', quantity: 2 } });
    ```
    
    In your React components, you can access the global state using the `useSelector` hook from the `react-redux` library and dispatch actions using the `useDispatch` hook:
    
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
    
    function CookingApp() {
      const cookingState = useSelector((state) => state.cookingState);
      const dispatch = useDispatch();
    
      // Dispatch an action to add an ingredient
      const handleAddIngredient = (name, quantity) => {
        dispatch({ type: 'ADD_INGREDIENT', payload: { name, quantity } });
      };
    
      // Rest of the component code
    }
    ```
<br />

4. Cleaning up:

    In React, the `useEffect` hook can also return a cleanup function that is called when the component is unmounted. You can use this to clean up any resources or reset the state before the component is removed from the screen.
    
    Using our cooking analogy, let's say you want to clean the dishes and reset the cooking state when you're done cooking. You can perform this cleanup inside the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function:
    
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    
    function CookingApp() {
      const [cookingState, setCookingState] = useState(initialState);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        // Update the UI or perform other actions based on cookingState
    
        return () => {
          // Clean up the cooking state or reset the dishes when the component is unmounted
        };
      }, [cookingState]);
    
      // Rest of the component code
    }
    ```
<br />

By using `useState`, `useEffect`, and Redux in React, you can effectively manage the state of your cooking process, clean up any resources or reset the state as needed, and ensure your cooking app is ready to be reused for future meals.
